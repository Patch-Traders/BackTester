Repository for custom back testing environment for deploying algorithmic trading strategies. 

Consider implementing a For-Loop back testing system to get our bearings before tackling an Event-Driven backtesting system. 

Need to Implement: 
- Securities Master Database
- Trading Strategies
- Portfolio and Order Management 
- Risk and Position Management 
- Execution Handling (both for backtesting and live trading) 
- Performance and Reporting
- Deployment & Monitoring (probably not an immediate focus)
